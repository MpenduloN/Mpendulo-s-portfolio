My Portfolio:
Hi, I’m Mpendulo Ngoma, a beginner developer diving into the world of web development and programming. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Python, and I’m excited to share my progress with you through a few projects I’ve worked on.

As I continue to learn and grow, I focus on building fun, interactive, and user-friendly applications. I’m passionate about creating simple, intuitive designs and I’m always looking for new challenges to improve my skills.
This portfolio will show you my progress this far and ways i can be contacted in.
